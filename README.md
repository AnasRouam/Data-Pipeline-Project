# Data-Pipeline-Project
I'll try to create a data pipeline for an imaginary company.

**Full Pipeline Example:**
1. Extract data from multiple sources (CSV, APIs, web scraping, etc.).
2. Transform the data by cleaning, aggregating, and combining it.
3. Load the data into a SQL database or a data warehouse.
4. Visualize the data in Power BI (create reports and dashboards).
5. Train a predictive model (e.g., regression or classification) on the data using Python.
6. Automate the pipeline (e.g., using cron jobs, Airflow, or Python scripts).
7. Deploy the model and use Power BI to update dashboards with new predictions.
